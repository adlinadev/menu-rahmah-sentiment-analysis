# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data

This project explores **sentiment analysis of tweets** using machine learning and visualization in **Power BI**.  
The goal is to analyze how people react (positive, negative, neutral) to specific topics based on Twitter data.

## Branches
- **[powerbi-dashboard](../../tree/powerbi-dashboard)** ‚Üí Contains the Power BI dashboard (`.pbix`), images, and documentation  
- **[data](../../tree/data)** ‚Üí Contains a dummy dataset (`.csv`) with the same structure as the original data  

## Project Overview
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Tweets were collected using a tweet harvesting tool.  
   - All tweets were translated into English for consistency.  
   - Due to confidentiality, only a **dummy dataset** is shared publicly (see `data` branch).  

2. **Text Processing & Word Cloud**  
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the tweets (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.).  
   - Generated a **Word Cloud** to visualize the most frequent terms.  

3. **Sentiment Classification**  
   - Tweets were categorized into three classes: **Positive**, **Negative**, **Neutral**.  
   - Machine learning models used: **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** and **Naive Bayes**.  

4. **Visualization in Power BI**  
   - Built an interactive dashboard to showcase sentiment trends and engagement metrics.  
   - See `powerbi-dashboard` branch for the `.pbix` file.

## Notes
- The real dataset cannot be shared publicly.  
- This repo provides a dummy dataset, word cloud, and a Power BI dashboard for demonstration.
