# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data

This project explores **sentiment analysis of tweets** using machine learning and visualization in **Power BI**.  
The goal is to analyze how people react (positive, negative, neutral) to specific topics based on Twitter data.

## Branches
- **[powerbi](../../tree/powerbi-dashboard)** → Contains the Power BI dashboard (`.pbix`) and documentation  
- **[data](../../tree/data)** → Contains a dummy dataset (`.csv`) with the same structure as the original data  

## Project Overview
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Tweets were collected using a tweet harvesting tool.  
   - All tweets were translated into English for consistency.  
   - Due to confidentiality, only a **dummy dataset** is shared publicly (see `data` branch).

2. **Sentiment Classification**  
   - Tweets were categorized into three classes: **Positive**, **Negative**, **Neutral**.  
   - Machine learning models were tested to evaluate classification performance.  

3. **Visualization in Power BI**  
   - Built an interactive dashboard to showcase sentiment trends and engagement metrics.  
   - See `powerbi-dashboard` branch for the `.pbix` file.

## Notes
- The real dataset cannot be shared publicly.  
- This repo provides a dummy dataset and a Power BI dashboard for demonstration.
